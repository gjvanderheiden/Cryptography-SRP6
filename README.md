# Cryptography-SRP6


Port from the Java project [Glusk/srp6-variables](https://github.com/Glusk/srp6-variables/) to Smalltalk.

Except that SmallTalk is not Java and does not need all the wrappers to be so versatile as Glusk's implementation is.

Used that library to make an Apple HomeKit protocol implmentation in Java, works like a charm, without any hacking. Seems like every use of chryptografy in a certain product defiates to some extend. The goal is to keep the library as flexible as the Glusk variant is.
